"""
This script processes all packages listed on PyPI's index to creates a database of what package(s) correspond to each import name
The index of all listed packages can be found here: https://pypi.python.org/simple/

The result is stored in a sqlite database

The database has two tables:
    "packages" and "package_imports"
However the best method is to use the view "v_package_imports" which omits some of the columns used for tracking
Which are unnecessary for end-users
The table has two columns:
    package_name        - The name of the package                   ex: "beautifulsoup4"
    import_as           - The name used to import the package       ex: "bs4"

The import_as column is indexed for fast lookups, as the import_as is the primary value that will be searched for

Since the scraping process can take several hours to complete, this is designed to be able to stop and restart mid-process
To avoid duplicating time-consuming work should it be stopped part-way through
