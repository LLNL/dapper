## Welcome to DAPper's documentation!

DAPper helps identify the software packages installed on a system, and expose implicit dependencies in source code.

The main tool for end users parses source code to determine packages that a C/C++ codebase depends on.
In addition, datasets mapping file names to packages that install them for various ecosystems are provided.
